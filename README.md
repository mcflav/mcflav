- 👋 Hi, I’m @mcflav
- 👀 I’m interested in contributing to team projects that use Angular, Node.js or any javascript/HTML/CSS.
- 🌱 I’m currently growing my skills in Angular as well as Node.js, and learning React and Mobile Applications, but as of recent I've been coding heavily on SPA's (Single Page Applications).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above frameworks and technologies. I also have repositories you can view and explore when you have time. If you have any suggestions on 
-     improvements or enhancements to my current repositories please feel free to let me know and we can collaborate on making them better! 
- 📫 You can reach me here on github or email me directly at nc2jax@hotmail.com.
